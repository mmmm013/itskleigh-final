Somehow to try to understand
If you would just give me a chance

They're just stories – baby, it’s not me

His baby girl was goin’ off on her own
Closed his eyes – oh – knew I had to go__ (he said)
Years come n’ go without explanation (If I could)
I’d do it all again without hesitation
The only thing diff’rent I’d need to do
Is spend more time with you n’
That’s a Have-To 
Daddy didn’t make it to my wedding day
Still, I knew he was with me anyway 
I could feel him as I walked the aisle alone 
Looked ahead - stared at a statue of Jesus (and I)
I wondered if somehow daddy could see us
…That night I placed a flower on his tombstone
Years come n’ go without explanation
(If I could) I’d do it all again without hesitation
The only thing diff’rent I’d need to do, 
Is spend more time with you 
Yeah…that’s a Have-To

V1a
So you are careless n’ peerless 
Not afraid of alone n’
You’re so fearless n’ tearless 
Through your whole life you’ve known
You had your own world to fill
You had your own cards to deal
You never knew what was real 
Just out there on your own

V1b 
So you do your best – you guess 
Nothin’ can get in your way
So you are fearless – you hear less 
In the senseless game you play
Off you are on another quest
Always havin’ to pass some test
Always needin’ to be the best
Show ‘em all you can play

Ch1
Fearless –- so fearless
You make your stand
Fearless –- fearless
You’re in command
No one’s ever gonna talk you down
This is your town, it’ll come around
This is your town, it’ll come around
 
V2 
So you are fearless – so fearless
Oh my, how you have grown
Now you are tearless n’ fearless
We see what you have shown (n’)
We can see through your game
I know how to hide your shame
So much less than the name
That’s why you’re all alone

V1 
If you wander the woods at midnight on Halloween
and something moves between the trees - rustling leaves
The ground shakes, and you trip on an old tombstone and 
you'll hear a sound that chills you to the bone! 

Ch1 
When the witches wizards and warlocksall romp
The ghosts and the demons and goblins clomp, clom
How they whirl and twirl all night 
I'm saying it's a frightening sight
When they're doing a dance they call
The Cemetery Stomp! 

V2 
Well the trolls 2-step like they're in a trance.
The ghouls shake like there are spiders in their pants
The vampires play the same song on and on (while)
Zombies try to keep up & sing along.

Leave the winter on the ground
I wake up lonely, there's air of silence
In the bedroom and all around
Touch me now, I close my eyes and dream away
It must have been love but it's over now
It must have been good but I lost it somehow
It must have been love but it's over now
From the moment we touched, 'til the time had run out
It must have been love
Make-believing we're together
That I'm sheltered by your heart
But in and outside I've turned to water
Like a teardrop in your palm
And it's a hard winter's day, I dream away

Where the front porch lights up the darkness

Is to get into my car n' just go

Only so much time n’ so much I can do 
Tryin' what I can to turn things around

There's some hidden limit that I can't get past 

When I'm out searchin' for some Promised Land 

End up feelin' like I’m drivin' through a mile of thick sand 
Try to turn when those wheels just won't grab 
So I slow down n’ tell myself, it’s not that bad (as)

I find a reason to go on
It still beats true, through thoughts of you
Some confuse it with bein ’strong

No more tears fall - I built some walls
Made me a safe place to hide
Those same fears call, but I mask them all
I keep them somewhere inside
Somewhere inside

V2
I turn my cheek when mem'ries creep
I fight the feelin’ that comes
You broke my heart when I dropped my guard
You had me – then you had to run

Those same fears call, but I mask them all
I keep them somewhere inside

I let my heart go
I was such a fool
So I finally know
Tragedy takes two
In a lonely home
Silence tells me
Feelin ’alone’s
Not feelin' free

Like she's long since gone to another place
Breathes a real big sigh
Stuffs some papers in her bag 
Tries to walk away with pride 
She steps from court 
Wraps her scarf - as she heads towards the door
Grabbin' her keys, she leaves
She's divorced, now, and she's fin'ly free
But still lookin' for some peace
She done her best
Done what love told her to do
Said vows that turned meaningless - somehow 
As she meets a clear truth
Ev'rythin' seems so cold - so old
She feels so used
Tryin' to start life new 
She slips slowly -- into her car
Turns the key - wantin' to drive forever far
Both hands on the wheel 
Now she can't feel (nothin') 
Ev'rythin's movin', but she sits still 
She done her best
Done what love told her to do
Said vows that turned meaningless - somehow 
As she meets a clear truth
Ev'rythin' seems so cold - so old
She feels so used
Tryin' to start life new 
New doesn't sound as nice
As it did when she sat alone at night
Wishin' a way  to make things right
Old clothes, old heart, old lies
That's what filled up her life
She's so tired
Nothin' new's left inside 
She done her best
Done what love told her to do

It's been seven hours and fifteen days
Since you took your love away
I go out every night and sleep all day
Since you took your love away

Since you've been gone I can do whatever I want
I can see whomever I choose
I can eat my dinner in a fancy restaurant
But nothing
I said nothing can take away these blues

'Cause nothing compares
Nothing compares to you

It's been so lonely without you here
Like a bird without a song
Nothing can stop these lonely tears from falling
Tell me, baby, where did I go wrong

I could put my arms around every boy I see
But they'd only remind me of you
I went to the doctor and guess what he told me?
Guess what he told me?
He said, ""Girl, you better try to have fun no matter what you do,""
But he's a fool

'Cause nothing compares
Nothing compares to you

All the flowers that you planted, mama, in the back yard
All died when you went away
I know that living with you, baby, was sometimes hard
But I'm willing to give it another try

Nothing compares
Nothing compares to you
Nothing compares
Nothing compares to you
Nothing compares
Nothing compares to you

A woman on the radio talks about revolution
When it's already passed her by
Bob Dylan didn't have this to sing about
Didn't know it could feel this good to be alive

I was alive and I waited, waited
I was alive and I waited for this
Right here, right now
There is no other place I wanna be
Right here, right now
Watching the world wake up from history

I saw the decade end, when it seemed the world could change
At the blink of an eye
And if anything
Then there's your sign of the times

I was alive and I waited, waited

Starin’ at stars n’ doin’ some wishin’

Sandy soil lays - where cowboy bones sleep
Many pass by this way – past where most trails end
Down by where the water bends
-- It’s a place trav'lers go to get close (to)
Find a way to behold that colossal stone
That’s who you are to me
When stormy winds knock me off my feet
I think of you n' I stand up
Reminds me the meaning of tough
I swear - you're there for me 
If I’m winnin’ or not
You are my rock
This shrine draws folks from miles around
Has its history of mystery - with this town
They say that rock has stood the test of time
Through wars over leaders drawin’ lines
Blood was shed where soldiers fought (but)
All those bombshells couldn’t move that rock n'
That’s who you are to me

Frosty wind made moan,
Earth stood hard as iron,
Water like a stone;
Snow had fallen, snow on snow,
Snow on snow,
In the bleak mid-winter
Long ago.
Our God, Heaven cannot hold Him
Nor earth sustain;
Heaven and earth shall flee away
When He comes to reign:
In the bleak mid-winter
A stable-place sufficed
The Lord God Almighty,
Jesus Christ.
Enough for Him, whom cherubim
Worship night and day,
A breastful of milk
And a mangerful of hay;
Enough for Him, whom angels
Fall down before,
The ox and ass and camel
Which adore.
Angels and archangels
May have gathered there,
Cherubim and seraphim
Thronged the air,
But only His mother
In her maiden bliss,
Worshipped the Beloved
With a kiss.
What can I give Him,
Poor as I am?
If I were a shepherd
I would bring a lamb,
If I were a wise man
I would do my part,
Yet what I can I give Him,
Give my heart.",,,2025,,"Sad, Reflective, Minimal, Emotive",Christmas,Fast,"Piano, Bass",Female vocal,"Singer/songwriter, Pop, Indie, Folk","Recognizable, One stop, Mainstream, Easy-clear",,,"wav,mp3",0:03:41,Gregory D Putnam,100,ASCAP,G Putnam Music,,,,,,,,,,,,

Plowin' through that crowded school hall n' 
She was blockin' my path 
As I tried to get past  
Shot me a smile then she moved along 
On the bus that ev'nin'  
I was lookin' for a  seat n' 
Once again, stand-in' there 
Those blonde curls - blue eyes -  
Turn-the-world-upside-down with just a simple stare  
I couldn't find the words but I worked up  
The nerves just to say hello 
I was playin' it cool but the cold hard truth  
Was burnin' deep inside my soul 
If by happenstance we ran 
Into each other every single day 
Stay in my way  
I was at the supermarket 
Speedin' through in my cart n' 
She blocked the aisle I needed to go down 
I tried to get it together - should'a known better 
Well, I’m tellin’ this time around 
I couldn't find the words but I worked up  
The nerves just to say hello 
I was playin' it cool but the cold hard truth  
Was burnin' deep inside my soul 
If by happenstance we ran 
Into each other every single day 
Stay in my way  
Next time I saw her 
She gave me her number n' 
I called just to let her know... 
I'm glad I found the words n' the nerve 
To say more than just hello 
I was playin' it cool but this cold hard truth  
Was burnin’ deep inside my soul

Based on pure experimentation 
Expresses ideals of humanity  
Relies on rule by majority 
The right to vote is our lone hope 
To heed the truth our founders wrote 
Leaders should stand where we stand
That’s how we keep things American
Democracy
Guides the Land of Liberty 
You don’t always win, so earn your turn
We have to give n’ take - live n’ learn
…The vote keeps us free  
…Democracy
It’s to those values we need to cling
Should have nothin’ to do with money
A free vote is what makes it work (it’s)
How we ensure our voices our heard
We tell our kids to respect one another
Tell ‘em to be kind n’ share…(there’s)
A diff’rence between what they see n’ hear 
It’s belief versus greed, hate, n’ fear
Democracy
Guides the Land of Liberty 
You don’t always win so earn your turn 
We have to give n’ take - live n’ learn
…The vote keeps us free  
The Constitution lays out how it’s done
Explains government’s for ev’ryone
It don’t mention wealth or races (it)
Separates church n’ state - it embraces
That we’re all equal in th’ eyes of th’ law
Ev’ry vote matters n’ ev’ry vote talks 
That’s what the words say…(hell, it’s)
All in the name…(of)
Democracy…
You don’t always win, so earn your turn
We have to give n’ take - build not burn

This sensational musical piece typifies amazing creativity, which is flush in his music. His creativity can't be imagined.

NEITHER CAN HIS EXTREME PAIN & LIMITED MOBILITY. Might be the kindest person I've known, well among them/ He's as genuine as people come. 

HE NEEDS HELP! 

Any royalties received by Music Maykers, formerly G Putnam Music goes to a medical fund by Music Maykers, LLC. NO Admin charges. 

All $$ go to his fund set to support little things like food, utilities, medical support, transportation, clothing, school supplies, & so on.for 3 wonderful young kids, the youngest being 3. Wife lost job due to recent events. Great worker now drives an hour each way to work on clear roads at non-rush hour times. 

Too proud to ask. He & they all are humble. 

Will remain transparent throughout, & signed off by Michael, who has NO idea I'm doing this.  We live under an hour apart. Frankly, needs a sponsor. He may have flair for the genius at times in his creative space. Imagine if he could just do music. Would be unbelievable! .

To a ghost that’s long since  lost to my life

With each passing hour, times sweet taste is turning sour
My heart drags through, every minute
Cause the night goes so slow without you in it
What am I gonna do with this broken heart
How am I gonna keep my world from falling apart
What’ll I do when all the pieces fall
Where am I gonna hide when my eyes
My eyes tell it all

Every morning the world seem so strange
When I wake up to your smile
Every nightfall the world hasn’t changed
The memories run in circles, no they just won’t reconcile

This sensational musical piece typifies amazing creativity, which is flush in his music. His creativity can't be imagined.

NEITHER CAN HIS EXTREME PAIN & LIMITED MOBILITY. Might be the kindest person I've known, well among them/ He's as genuine as people come. 

HE NEEDS HELP! 

Any royalties received by Music Maykers, formerly G Putnam Music goes to a medical fund by Music Maykers, LLC. NO Admin charges. 

All $$ go to his fund set to support little things like food, utilities, medical support, transportation, clothing, school supplies, & so on.for 3 wonderful young kids, the youngest being 3. Wife lost job due to recent events. Great worker now drives an hour each way to work on clear roads at non-rush hour times. 

Too proud to ask. He & they all are humble. 

Will remain transparent throughout, & signed off by Michael, who has NO idea I'm doing this.  We live under an hour apart. Frankly, needs a sponsor. He may have flair for the genius at times in his creative space. Imagine if he could just do music. Would be unbelievable! .

104282855,THIS TIME IT'S LOVE,Clearly,Zach Jackson,95,"This song can be sung by either & both genders. It's a story song about a man growing up & into love. 

This minimal male-vocal, acoustic guitar/vocal, singer/songwriter tune addresses the issues regarding the age-old battle between love & commitment. The narrator turns the corner on Avenue Love. 

The strong vocal is Zach Jackson from nearby me in Normal, IL., and Zach composed this song to bring it to life. His interpretation nailed the feeling that Jackson's unique vocal convincingly conveys!

Playin' on a toy tractor - diggin' with its shovel

Now he's standing in that park

Took his time growin' up - wasn't in no kinda rush n'
Romance was a temptin' cliff, he thought he'd slip n'
To him the word forever felt like a push n'
He was afraid he'd someday be ambushed (but)

'Cause ----- this time --- this time --- this time
This time--it's love
Hearts that don't love, won't get broken (but)
When hope opened up - he closed down (when)
He'd let those 3 words slip, n' say he was jokin' n'
Didn't know how it feels to feel so proud
Took him some time to figure what love's about n'
Now, he's ready to take those vows

This sensational musical piece typifies amazing creativity, which is flush in his music. His creativity can't be imagined.

NEITHER CAN HIS EXTREME PAIN & LIMITED MOBILITY. Might be the kindest person I've known, well among them/ He's as genuine as people come. 

HE NEEDS HELP! 

Any royalties received by Music Maykers, formerly G Putnam Music goes to a medical fund by Music Maykers, LLC. NO Admin charges. 

All $$ go to his fund set to support little things like food, utilities, medical support, transportation, clothing, school supplies, & so on.for 3 wonderful young kids, the youngest being 3. Wife lost job due to recent events. Great worker now drives an hour each way to work on clear roads at non-rush hour times. 

Too proud to ask. He & they all are humble. 

Will remain transparent throughout, & signed off by Michael, who has NO idea I'm doing this.  We live under an hour apart. Frankly, needs a sponsor. He may have flair for the genius at times in his creative space. Imagine if he could just do music. Would be unbelievable! .

I was ready to get up when in steps an old gent
Sat down by me, turned his tired face my way
In a shaky voice softly asked me to stay
He told me about a friend from his childhood
who worked hard, got ahead, set out to do good
Made money then greed, chasing destiny
In his race to the top, there were things he forgot
See if you think money is what it means to succeed
If you'd take a closer look at what life should be
It's kindness, love, being happy, and look at me, now look at me.
If you tell the truth, it truly paves your path
If you tell a lie, have to keep on looking back
If you want to meet that man with selfish dreams, 
Sonny look at me, yeah look at me.
The old man grew a new sadness and regret
A wife took the kids, didn't really care that they left
When he fell ill, so few came to the hospital
Saw how so much money really brought him so little
If you think money is what it means to succeed
If you take a closer look at what life should be
It's kindness, love, being happy, and look at me, now look at me.
If you tell the truth, it truly paves your path
If you tell a lie, have to keep on looking back
If you want to meet that man with selfish dreams, sonny look at me, yeah look at me.
Scooted back in his chair, stood up, said don't be scared
Unless you look in the mirror and see someone like me
Really I've got nobody
No it's not where time went, it's about how it's spent
If we think money is what it means to succeed
If we take a closer look at what life should be
It's kindness, love, being happy and shouldn't that be true for everybody?
If we tell the truth it truly paves our paths

V1
I went out to be alone 'neath the moon n' stars
Sat right where my ev'ry-day-friend & I drank
We'd squat here weekends - close the bars (we'd be)
Laughin' & cacklin' at my bad jokes n' dang
10 months later life threw what I call a final boomerang
A final goodbye - played your last card

PreCh1
When you left - you left quick - it hit real hard n'
I'm stumblin' - crumblin' - my life's been scarred

Ch1
Now you're a mem'ry trapped in time n'
I'd be lyin' to say I'm fine - I'm tryin' ..... (to)
Remember tomorrow's a quiet promise n'
Tonight feels brisk n' to be honest
The only thing I know it all feels so wrong
Really....truly....cross my heart until dawn
The true forever.....
The real real forever ....
The only forever's that you're gone

V2
A broken heart needs time to heal for real n'
Maybe sometimes in some ways it never will
At a time when it all feels so surreal
Permanence rises high like to the sky - still
I chew my lip so as not to cry - oh why

PreCh2 [optional]
Times roll along - you might get caught off guard
Tragedies don't come light - they draw dark

Ch2
Now you're a mem'ry trapped in time n'

Beyond the touch but within the sense
Time paints each reason, yesterday confessed
Reach inside where you face the test
Won’t let you rest
Minds find reasons - like stars feed night skies
Can’t find a flicker without some sunlight
How can a lost dream become reconciled
When the storm hovers so deep in disguise
Now, who decides
Time’s hidin’ answers from heaven sent
While people run ahead, askin’ where time went
Chasin’ gold like it’ll shake the cold
Won’drin’ why your senses turn numb
Can you feel love
Those glossy, metal walls still reflect your soul
Never defined, love is divined
To be today, what shines tomorrow
Look well past inside to call it love
Will you let it come

V1) You may wonder who told me
That you found somebody new
But, when did you last hold me
N’ when did I last see you__
You’re runnin’ with a new heart
No, I don’t understand
You left me without a word
Like a fool -- well, I guess I am__
I walk to the river 
N’ I just sit here
I feel the cold creepin’ in
I hear the whisp’rin’ in the wind

Ch) It wasn’t words from a friend
It wasn’t somethin’ that I saw
There was no announcement
I didn’t get no phone call
In the end, I closed my eyes (n’ then)
I heard that lonesome cry 
Again n’ again…
I hear the whisp’rin’ in the wind
Coda: Can’t get past the whisp’rin’ in the wind

V2) Friends will ask n’ I pretend
I say we just need some time
I walk on n’ they laugh
They know you left me behind__
I have nowhere to go
Walk to the river’s bend
I stare at the water’s flow
Askin’ why it never ends__
Tomorrow’s another day
Just words some people say
I don’t know where to begin

V1 
If you wander the woods at midnight on Halloween
and something moves between the trees - rustling leaves
The ground shakes, and you trip on an old tombstone and 
you'll hear a sound that chills you to the bone! 

Ch1 
When the witches wizards and warlocksall romp
The ghosts and the demons and goblins clomp, clom
How they whirl and twirl all night 
I'm saying it's a frightening sight
When they're doing a dance they call
The Cemetery Stomp! 

V2 
Well the trolls 2-step like they're in a trance.
The ghouls shake like there are spiders in their pants
The vampires play the same song on and on (while)
Zombies try to keep up & sing along.

His bankbook’s grown full – his time’s in a race
Can’t really feel love but knows it has its place
His heart’s on empty n’ where’s that he’s gettin’?
Greed must be temptin’ but The Gates don’t take gold 
So - it’s like goin’ to church……without a soul

V2
Chasin' fast cash n’ run with fast girls – life's blessed
Don’t care no one’s there – if it's time to cry
He walks the halls some call success 
Carry your weight when it’s your time
In heaven best not try lies - you can't hide

He can fold his hands in prayer 
Without sincerely bein' there
Confused - debonair

""I Live Free"" is an electrifying club dance anthem that pulsates with infectious beats and euphoric melodies, inviting listeners to break free from the confines of everyday life and embrace the liberating power of music on the dance floor.

Thanks for listening! 

This sensational musical piece typifies amazing creativity, which is flush in his music. His creativity can't be imagined.

NEITHER CAN HIS EXTREME PAIN & LIMITED MOBILITY. Might be the kindest person I've known, well among them/ He's as genuine as people come. 

HE NEEDS HELP! 

Any royalties received by Music Maykers, formerly G Putnam Music goes to a medical fund by Music Maykers, LLC. NO Admin charges. 

All $$ go to his fund set to support little things like food, utilities, medical support, transportation, clothing, school supplies, & so on.for 3 wonderful young kids, the youngest being 3. Wife lost job due to recent events. Great worker now drives an hour each way to work on clear roads at non-rush hour times. 

Too proud to ask. He & they all are humble. 

Will remain transparent throughout, & signed off by Michael, who has NO idea I'm doing this.  We live under an hour apart. Frankly, needs a sponsor. He may have flair for the genius at times in his creative space. Imagine if he could just do music. Would be unbelievable! .

About who I have become
Not exactly who I imagined
When I sang a younger song
I think about my school days
And all the promises back then
A dream I could hold on to
And time my closest friend
And I know, I know
That time keeps passing by
Like cars on the freeway
A billion different lives
And the faster we are moving
All the less and less we see I never thought the man I dreamt of 
Would become a reality
I know I need forgiveness 
From those I left behind 
And I know I must forgive the ones 
That almost left me blind 
At times I forget my reasons
And push my virtues aside
But there’s a thread of love within me
And it’s down for the long ride
And time can sometimes just slip
Sometimes there’s not enough hours in a single day
But I now there’s more than this
Oh I know there’s more than this
But I know I know 
But time keeps passing by
Like cars on the freeway 
A billion, billion different lives 
And the faster we are moving 
All the less and less we see

Greg",Clayton Michael Gunn (100%) ASCAP 462448938,Rap,ONE STOP - G Putnam Music owns Masters & Publishing Control,,"Let me say a few words right here, right now 
Before I forget who I am before I let you down
Cause it's just not easy going to town
On lyrical matter, on musical ground 
See, I was born with this call it a gift or a curse
Riding beats with a keyboard and adding a verse
Sometimes it feels like it's better or worse
But I hope I don't get in your way
Cause shit sometimes hurts
Some days you know it all comes easy
Some days it just don't come
Some days it's an uphill battle 
Some days there's a war to be won
But I hope I don't step on your precious toes 
And I hope I don't get on your precious nose 
Cause this is who I am and this is the way it goes 
This is the way it goes I don't know half the shit I do 
But I'm in this game till the game is through 
So much negativity coming straight from you
But I just don't care,
I got shit to do 
Cause I'm caught in the game,
I'm caught in a war 
You can see the windows,
I've locked all the doors 
I've locked out friends, done this before
Cause you were hating on me, but you ain't no more 
I could just give up, just suit yourself
All my dreams up on the shelf 
Gotta go through the nine to five and live in hell 
But I don't see that happening in my honest self 
See, if one was to go, one was to stay
I've been riding tomorrow in a lonely way 
But at least I don't have me in the fire inside 
That I was just born with that will never die 
It must be so hard to see a dream 
Of a man with drive, is it just obscene?
Someone who ignores the jealousy 
A rolling stone, a man who's free 
Never with a curse, playing till it hurts 
Running with a passion for better or worse 
But you just can't take what to me is at stake 
My own inner convictions to never be fake
I ain't going down to someone else's obsession 
Dipping the flame in my own confession 
I guess I'm the only one who learned my lesson 
That if I would give up, I would just be stressing 
He’s a part of me that you don't understand 
And if I gave up, I'd be losing a hand 
It's a part of what makes up this very man 
And I'll keep on going until the end 
I don't know what half the shit I do 
But I'm in this game till the game is through 
So much negativity coming straight from you 
But I just don't care,
I got shit to do 
Cause I'm caught in the game,
I'm caught in a war 
You can see the windows,
I've locked all the doors 
I've locked out friends, done this before 
Cause you were hating on me, but you ain't no more 
I could just give up to suit yourself 
Put all my dreams up on the shelf 
Gonna go for the 9 to 5 and live and live in hell 
But I don't see that happening in my outer self 
See if one wants to go and one wants to stay 
I'd been riding tomorrow in a lonely way 
But at least I don't have me in the fire inside 
That I was just born with that will never die
I don't know what half the shit I do

I did not know what I could do

To believe that I was into you

there's a surefire way.
Just forget your dreams,
push them far away.

One day.
I don't know.
There's something in the way.
I can see you're a simple man.
You just get by with whatever you can.
Come with me and take my hand.
I'll show you something you'll understand.
See that girl?
She's a powerful singer.
You can see from here she could be a winner.
She's so weighed down thinking about tomorrow.
Before it's arrived,
she's filled with sorrow.
She could go out and stand the street 
With a CD player sound to beat
She has a voice.
She's got a voice.
She's got a voice.
She's got a voice.
She's got a voice.
We have to hear.
But she's still afraid.
She's consumed by fear.

Now we move to the second phase
You know how you could live your days
You have a dream that you believe
All you need to do is just break free
From the chains of fear itself
Use your head, use your mouth 
Push that fear from behind
You must make your sound, now's your time
But you must stand
Rise up, be a stronger man 
You feel this future lies ahead 
You'll always remember when you said
 I won't live with fear no more 
I won't be afraid to close the door 
In front of me lies a path 
And freedom is the ultimate 
Fear will always hold you back 
Fear will always bring you down 
Fear will always crush your dreams into 
So you just remember who you are
You and me be so much better 
So keep me around

Why am I here on this earth?
Was I put here to barely survive

Was I meant to change somebody's life
And then go home and retire?
But I can feel something stirring inside 
That makes me wanna go so much higher

I wanna get to the top 
To see the other side

And I'm looking down 
I know where I'm going

More than living day to day
I wanna go through seasons in my life

I wanna stop and stare 
At the things that send tingles down my side 
I wanna chase my dreams

By thoughts of misery and doubt.
One day your troubles will be over

I'm sure you'll find what you need.

Don't feel alone in all your problems.
You know my hand is always yours.

Never felt so good,
never felt so right
Thinking about you with no goals in mind
Missing all those we left behind We're crazy,
we're out of our minds
We've had one hell of a ride
Seeing you standing there tonight
With your drinking hand in the warm moonlight
Girl, you look so beautiful to me
And I started thinking where I would have been 
If not for your love that drew me in 
There's so many pages to our biography 
Like what about the night we met You were so cool
I was so scared 
Each other no more than a mystery 
And here I'm standing at the bar 
Watching you on stage with your dad's guitar 
And I can't believe you're coming home with me

We've seen our battles and conquered our fears

Greg",Clayton Michael Gunn (100%) ASCAP 462448938,"Pop, Indie",ONE STOP - G Putnam Music owns Masters & Publishing Control,,"Yeah, this is the story of my life.
I don't really know how else to explain it.
So I guess I just gotta, well,
tell the truth.
Here goes.
Everytime that I step out the door
There’s always something there that makes me want more
My insatiable appetite for things that shine,
Clouds my judgement and screws with my mind
I don’t think I’m greedy, I give to the needy
I promise that I’ll love you if you never leave
I’m Fighting everyday with the demons in my head
My next piece of sunshine will be when I’m dead
I try my best to please a brother
I care for my sisters give love to my mother
Though I know deep down not a day goes that the love I receive I will always rely
I get so scared when I’m on my own
When I take one step outside my comfort zone
There’s a world out there I’m so afraid
Sometimes I wake up my beds already made

Sometimes when I get so low and I'm without a friend,
I wish I could go back and I could start again.
Yeah, I believe in God.
It's my right.
There's so many times coming through the night.
I'm being so lucky to have seen the face of the creator of the human race.
But with all that said,
it's a constant fight.
I'm loving every day because I'm scared of every night.
Satan's in my head trying to take me away.
It's a constant battle that I live with every day.
Sometimes I think,
screw my life.
Close the door.
Pickup the knife
But I gotta believe there's another side.
He didn't die in vain.
Jesus gave his life.
Why waste mine?
I must do what I can.
I've gotta do something to be a better man.
I can't go back.
No,
I can't go back.
I can't go back and I can’t start again.
Oh, what a life gotta be this hard for the world.
Why was I dealt this card
Sometimes when I get so low and I'm without a friend,
I wish I could go back and I could start again.
Do I turn left?
Do I turn right?
How can I tell when my goal's not inside?
Do I trust my gut feeling when I'm staring at the ceiling trying to decide which thought to believe in?
I need some guidance.
I need some direction.
Life's a jigsaw puzzle.
Time for a new section 
I need God's love.
I need God's affection.
Make no mistakes.
Attain to perfection.
Will I turn the corner with false ambition?
It's human race,
but it's not a competition.
Sometimes I think I just need to shut up and listen,
So much to see
So many things I'm missing.
I need to change the place.
I need to just slow down.
I need to pray to God to turn things around.
Life is tough.
No denying.
I'd say it's a breeze,
but I would be lying.
Life’s no breeze.
I must confess.
It's full of disappointment and distress.
It's a constant battle.
A constant war.
Yet it keeps you
Wanting more?
A touch of gladness to wipe away your tears.
It's been this way for years.
Yeah.
Oh Lord,
why does life
Gotta be this hard father why was I dealt 
This card
Sometimes when I get so low and I'm without a friend,
I wish I could go back and I could start again.
Oh Lord,
why does life
Gotta be this hard, father why was I 
Dealt this card
Sometimes when I get so low and I'm without a friend,
I wish I could go back and I could start again.
Well, it's my life.
It's what I live with.
Every day.
Day in the life.
It's my story.",930382953,,,,"Uplifting, Upbeat, Moody, Bright, Atmospheric","Life, Hope, Friendship, Faith, Identity, Struggle",Midtempo,"Synth, Percussion, Keyboard",Male vocal,"Pop, Indie",One stop,,,mp3,0:04:57,Clayton Michael Gunn,100,ASCAP,G Putnam Music,,,,,,,,,,,,

Lead to honest love most the time

To stop me from falling

But who doesn't know I wasn't far behind
Mind you, was doing my work like soap and crimes
And I heard something sounded like a talk 
Which surely followed a tick from that wall clock 
Time for me to get soap, I swear
Maybe I need to crawl out from my shell 
Lower my big boy and raise a little hell 
Free hits and loose ends
Cold kiss and tell 
Well, I'll need a weekend But going out the deep end 
When the going gets toughed 
The tough get gone 
Whenever waters get rough 
I'll be rowing 
When someone forgets or trips a problem arises 
I get it fixed,
I started almost hating surprises
Everyday has them if you open your eyes 
And that's what I'm trying 
So you're buying 
Maybe I need to crawl out from my shell 
Lower my big boy and raise a little hell
Well, I'll need a weekend 
But going out the deep end 
Been working so strong for so darn long 
Nice to feel happy again But obviously 
All good things must come to an end 
So let the end justify the means
To crawl out from my shell 
Back to being a big boy 
And a more than kind of hazing hell 
I left some loose ends And some cold kiss and tell Well,
I'll need a weekend 
But going out the deep end 
Time for me to crawl out from my shell 
Back to being a big boy 
And a more than kind of hazing hell 
 left some loose ends 
And some cold kiss and tell
Have a weekend 
But going out the deep end

teenage romance.

I'm just a little bit lost 
I need to find my way back home

Hey, do you know where I'm at?
I'm feeling quite lonely
Feeling quite lonely
Standing in this dark, dark forest
I've been standing here all my life
I realize that I've got no one to love me 
I've been wasting all my time
Treating people like peas 
That little kids won't eat
Dropping them to the ground 
Waiting for them to get beat
Hey,
I'm feeling really lost 
It's completely dark out here 
I've got no friends out here 
Hey, I think I know why
I've got no friends out here 
I've got no friends out here
I've got no friends out here 
Because I've been in awful friend 
Putting myself before others
Not thinking about each other 
I'm the only one out here
Cause I have no cheer 
Never talk to anyone 
Unless I'm making fun of them 
Now I realize why I'm in 
This dark,dark forest
I never care for anyone

When I seen a tall drink of holy water hotter than you know what
Instead of sliding in real smooth like usual, stumbling in like a fool
Cuz that whiskey dictates my game way too much
Every which way I play it, life gets a bit out of tune
Land on my one too many three chords and the truth
I don't fret when I get offset
You can bet I'm gonna rock and roll on through
Like that needle hitting the vinyl taking me so high
Yeah, sometimes it don't spin right
You can't move too far forward if you keep trying to hit rewind
Well, I clocked in 10 minutes earlier than I typically do
They say hard work pays off so here I am paying my dues
It hit the fan when the bossman came and 
thought he'd talk a little more about a bit of a raise
And Lord let's just say, he didn't show up to sing my praises
Every which way I play it, life gets a bit out of tune
Land on my one too many three chords and the truth
I don't fret when I get offset

and spilled my drink on her shirt
She screamed out no,

Then I stepped on her toe,

He dressed me down in a ten minute sentence
I stood calm and quiet as my attention left
He asked if I cared. 
Guess I should have said yes
Swear I was really trying

Cruising on through the day
But my mind finds fast forward
and I'm not sure what I'm heading toward
I tell myself I'm doing just fine
When out of the blue comes one of those times
Where I swear I was really trying
And thought I was playing it cool

If you want to hurt me just wait.

Telling lies look at me in the eyes
Walked out the door 'cause you could not disguise who you were
Who you are, a liar, a cheater, a parasite

But your pride took a dive so low
Who could hurt you beautiful?
Well look in the mirror and you might find
All the reasons I left you behind
To think about it it's plain to see
The only one ever hurting was me
Why did you have to hurt me for?
I don't understand, it came to the end and I was walking out the door
Why did you have to hurt me for?
No more to say, no games to play, and I was walking out the door.
You turned it on, you became someone I just could not understand
You beat the system, played the victim, you lied through your teeth to get me back again
We made mistakes, this I know, but the biggest I made was trusting you
To open up, share my soul, I thought it was something beautiful
But you were cold, you had no end, I know you tried to understand
But you're so precious, self-absorbed, you lost me 'cause you could not afford
To be the good one, to share your heart
A closed book, I should have seen from the start
You led me on, lied to me, and now you're trying to destroy me
Oh, why did you have to hurt me for?
No more to say, no games to play, and I was walking out the door

Lost my peace, my happiness, I had nothing to confess
Why did you have to hurt me for?
I've lost my faith, give up the race, tried to smile as you spat in my face
Lost my peace, my happiness, I had nothing to confess

Look at the stars and wonder why
Why has it taken all this time
I just want the best out of my life
All I want to do is be close to you
And start living my life again
Don't want to cry, crying’s just for fools
I want to see where you are, to get my tears back again
But if I look too hard, I might miss my chance
To reconcile the truth
But if I never try, I might lose everything
I've already lost you
I've already lost you
Stuck in a prison of lies
I've tried to escape so many times
But every time I try
I get pushed right back inside
I don't wanna be here, I've got to leave
Get me out of here, somebody please
Nowhere to run, no place to go
I think I've lost my very soul
The last time we met, I think I hurt you bad
Said some things about you that I shouldn't have
Tell me where you are, and I'll be there soon
Don't say that it's too late, don't say that I have lost you
Don't worry baby, I'll be home soon
Together baby, just me and you
I'm getting better at getting on
Wait for me baby, I won't be long
It's okay baby, it's like it should
I'm worried baby, where are you?

I know it's been so long since your head felt right
It's always coming, it's always coming through
The thoughts and lies from your demons, try to take over you
But you're so much stronger in your heart you know
You can feel you shine, you feel you glow
There's so much behind you to try and steal your grace
But you're a fighter
You know you'll find your way

Do I think too much
need less to say

I find it hard

I'm still scared of my thoughts
that lead to words I have to say
Do I fall in love

On the other side
of love there's hate
And I never want to flip that coin and see
and think of ways love could backfire on me

I give my life, to heart and mind in every way that I can find

Every reason so timeless inside the word goodbye

Sat right where my everyday friend and I drank
We'd squad here weekends, close the bars
We'd be laughing and cackling at bad jokes and dang.
Ten months later life threw a final boomerang
Final goodbye, played your last card
When you left, wasn't quick, hit me real hard
Now I'm stumbling, crumbling, my life's been scarred
Now your memory trapped in time, and I'd be lying to say I'm fine.
I'm trying to grasp how tomorrow's a frail promise
In tonight's risk, and to be honest all I know is
It all feels so wrong
Really, truly cross my heart now 'til dawn
One true forever, one really real forever
The only forevers that you're gone.
A broken heart needs time to heal for real
And maybe sometimes in some ways it never will
At a time when it all feels so surreal
Permanence rises high as the sky is still
I chew my lip so as not to cry, oh why
Time rolls along, you might get caught off guard
Tragedies don't come light, they draw dark
Now your memory trapped in time, and I'd be lying to say I'm fine.

over and over and over with you.
Two worlds collide
out in the stars
we race at the speed of light.
Your hand in mine,
soaring through life,
racing through space.
We're still young,
and we're still free,
and we don't know where we're going.
But if we stay together,
I know we'll discover these mysteries.
And I'm falling in love over and over and over with you.
Out in the stars, out of our minds, out of control.
And I'm falling in love over and over and over with you.
And I'll never forget the way that this feels.
I'll never let go.
Sometimes I feel like I'm dreaming on a sea of dreams
that carried me away
from the life I knew so long ago.
You rescued me and gave me shelter
in the love that is your arms.
And I won't look back 'cause you're all I see.
You're all I need.
And I'm falling in love over and over and over with you.
and I'll never forget the way that this feels.

share some warmth with everyone.

We drive by the old courthouse where he'd like to turn south.
Drive past the elevator said, ""Hey town, I'll see you later.""
Grandpa would hit the gas, said son, don't ever look back.
Make sure what you're doing's right so you can look 'em in the eye.
You got to stand tall, give it your all.
Do your best and don't settle for less.
Ride the tiger, reach even higher.
But remember this, life's just a test.

Yeah, I have friends and family
Still this place don't feel like home
Life just ain't what I thought it would be
I get up, grab a cup of coffee, start my morning routine
Play some music, search the sky, feeling kind of empty
It's like something's missing and it keeps me guessing
Looking for answers and blessings
So much a struggle and I easily stumble
Making my way, trying to find the piece that I am in this puzzle
Maybe it's faith, maybe it's this maze
I'm walking 'round, feeling half-dazed
See people chasing money, blindly running
Right past moments they should embrace
Head out, grab my purse and keys, so dang ready to leave
Play some music, one more night, looking for what I need

I can't be thinking 'bout you
How can I be keeping my distance

And I don't know why, I'm still sleeping on the floor
and after all this time, I'm second guessing myself
And I don't know how you wouldn't come back if you could
And I don't know why this house feels bigger than it should
I keep crying forever
Can't keep myself locked up inside
The clock's still stuck on quarter to midnight
The hours turn the days into nights
And I don't know who you've moved on to now
Did you tell her it's forever when you only want right now?
And I don't know if it makes you feel like a man
to crash through like waves then wash me away like the sand
Here I am, back to where I began
Begging and hoping to trust myself again
Picking up the pieces of my shattered broken heart
Getting up off of my knees and dragging myself back to the start

Half the world on my mind again
Seems for every job done, three others come
I head out to the barn like any other day
And suddenly there you are, laying in the hay

your eyes shine with the light of 
a thousand moons 
so bright
Then soon they reflect like deflecting me, 
resenting me 
Who I need to be.
Sometimes your life can feel so tough
Sometimes you feel like you're ready to give up
I look at your sad eyes, looking for real love
And I wonder if I've really done enough
or if I've done too much
Is it me?
Is it you?
Is it us?
You flip your hair when you're feeling coy
round boys who know what's real, 
what's poised, no one knows
quite what road we go
riding one rail as our love came so close
Sometimes your life can feel so tough
Sometimes you feel like you're ready to give up
I look at your sad eyes, looking for real love
and I wonder if I've really done enough
or if I've done too much
Is it me?
Is it you?
Is it us?
Let's live today, 
let go of the past
The turn to tomorrow, 
it's coming so damn fast
See I'm your man, 
I'll do anything I can
to help you understand
we're gonna last
Sometimes life can feel so tough
Sometimes it's hard to know just what you want
I look at your sad eyes looking up
at me and I wonder if I've really done enough

in Vegas cleaning up on Texas hold'em,
they don't know what it's like not to win.
Some people find some way to get good luck.
I'm under a dark cloud I'm no-luck struck.
I take a wrong turn or don't wait long enough.
Look right instead of turning left no, 
I have no luck with luck.
No luck with luck.
No luck with luck.
Never winning a raffle drawing
or making the critical traffic light.
Stalled in life, right place at the wrong time.

I take a wrong turn or don't wait long enough.
Look right instead of left, 
No I have no luck with luck.
No luck with luck.
Luck is a cloud,
unpredictable and dark with doubt,
as luck would have it, I've sure been left out.

Greg",Clayton Michael Gunn (100%) ASCAP 462448938,Singer/Songwriter,ONE STOP - G Putnam Music owns Masters & Publishing Control,,"This morning I swear
things felt real different
The toast wasn't burnt,
my lessons were learned
We talked late last night
Today I went
out to see him
the world had turned.
Now I'm living out a fantasy,
every time you see me,
I find feelings I lost,
I can't believe.
Holding hands, walking down the street,
right in front of God n' everybody.
Me in love,
Being in love,
Me in love
Being in love.
Me in love with you.
This evening I dared
to run past your place
hid my face
when you looked my way.
I raced by as if I hadn't,
something would have happened n'
we'd be a cartoon with captions
We'd be laughing, 
now I'm living out a fantasy
every time you see me,
I'm found feelings I lost.
I can't believe
holding hands walking down the street
right in front of God n' everybody.
Me in love,
Being in love.
Me in love
with you.
Now I'm living out a fantasy.
Every time you see me, n'
I found feelings I lost.
I can't believe
holding hands, walking down the street,
right in front of God n' everybody.
Me in love,
Being in love.
Me in love,
Being in love.
Me in love with you.",,,,,"Sad, Reflective, Minimal, Light, Hopeful, Atmospheric","Love, Happiness, Desire, Celebration, Connection, Relationship, Grateful, AFFECTIONATE",Slow,"Piano, Percussion",Male vocal,"Singer/songwriter, R&B, Pop","One stop, Mainstream, Demo",,,"wav,mp3",0:03:53,Clayton Michael Gunn,50,ASCAP,G Putnam Music,Gregory D Putnam,50,ASCAP,G Putnam Music,,,,,,,,
